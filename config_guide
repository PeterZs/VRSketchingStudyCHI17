STUDY 1

Each config/ folder contains three files: 0.txt, 1.txt, and 2.txt. Each file contains the factor sequence for a particular condition. Of course, the condition in 0.txt was presented to the user first, followed by the one in 1.txt, and lastly by the one in 2.txt.

Each factor is setup via a command, which is read as a lowercase character followed by a number. The character identifies the factor being setup, and the number identifies the variant of that factor.

Factors
c	condition,
p 	drawing plane orientation, 
s	stroke shape,
l	stroke size,
t	trial number

Sequences
c	0:traditional, 1:hybrid, 2:vr
p	0:vertical, 1:sideways, 2:horizontal
s	0:uline, 1:vline, 2:circle
l	0:small, 1:medium, 2:large


STUDY 2

Each config/ folder contains a single config.txt file which details the whole factor combination sequence that a participant was exposed to. The commands are described usin a syntax similar to that of study 1.

Factors
v	visual guidance
o	drawing surface orientation
s	surface shape
t	trial number

Seuences
v	0:none, 1:surface, 2:stroke, 3:both
o	0:(0, 0), 1:(0, -90), 2:(0, 90), 3:(-90, 0), 4:(90, 0), 5:(0, 45), 6:(0, -45), 7:(45, 0), 8:(-45, 0), 9:(45, 45), 10:(-45, 45), 11:(-45, -45), 12:(45, -45)
s	0:flat, 1:curved
